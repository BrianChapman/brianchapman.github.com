<h3>About</h3>

For 10 years I worked as an engineer doing consulting gigs mostly for the public sector. Although I was interested in engineering (I’m interested in just about anything technical), it just didn’t feel right. The saying goes “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” Well I was working too hard for this to be the job I love.

I found myself spending more mental energy maintaining the firms computing and databases than actual engineering and realized that this is what I love to do! Why don’t I just do this instead of what I’m doing now? So I followed my dream and quit my engineering job and dove into the world of software development.

That was late 2010. Now I’m a consultant with a handful of clients doing what I love and I havn’t worked a day since.

This blog is about sharing my learning experiences and joining the global discussion of software development.
