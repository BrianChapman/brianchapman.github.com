title: Parent POM Shortcut in Eclipse

Here is a quick way to navigate to the parent pom file in a maven eclipse project. Hold &lt;ctrl&gt; down while clicking within the &lt;parent&gt; tag. Eclipse will open the parent pom file.

This also works with other tags in the pom file. Holding &ln;ctrl&gt; while clicking a dependency will open that dependencyâ€™s declaration.
